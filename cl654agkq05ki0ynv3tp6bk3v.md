## Linux Assembly on macOS

Computer Organisation / Architecture courses usually require writing Assembly code for Linux.

What I'll address here is **how to easily run Linux Assembly on macOS machines**.

## TL;DR

There are a few ways how to do it, IMO the easiest and most pleasant way is to use `Docker`:

1. Watch this great 2-h [Docker Tutorial for Beginners](https://youtu.be/fqMOX6JJhGo) from the FreeCodeCamp (optional).
2. Install Docker Desktop for macOS and start `Docker`.  
   You can check that everything is alright by executing `$ docker ps` command and not having errors.
3. Create a `Dockerfile` in the folder with your Assembly code
   ```Dockerfile
   # Dockerfile
   FROM ubuntu:latest

   RUN apt-get update
   RUN apt-get install -y gcc
   RUN apt-get install -y make
   ```
4. Create `docker-compose.yml` file in the same folder as `Dockerfile`.
   ```yml
   # docker-compose.yml
   version: "3"
   services:
       linux:
           image: linux-image
           container_name: linux-container
           build:
               context: .
           command: sleep 1000
           volumes:
               - .:/code
      ```
5. Run `$ docker-compose up`
6. Connect to the container via `$ docker exec -it linux-container bash`

You are ready to go! Your code will be in the `/code/` folder. You can edit it inside a docker container and changes will be seen in the host and vice versa because it is a "shared folder".

After a container has stopped (with `CTRL-C`, for example), you can start it again by repeating 5-6 steps.

## The _"Clumsy"_ Way (VM)

You can use VMs like `Virtual Box` or `Parallels` or `VM Ware`.

### Pros

-   It may be a bit easier to start with, but the sacrifice in the experience doesn't worth it IMO =).

### Cons

-   Those apps are either:
    -   Free and shitty (slow, ugly, and require quite a bit of time to set up everything),
        like `Virtual Box`.
    -   Or paid and a bit less shitty, like `Parallels`.
-   They really may take the time. I gave up on setting "Shared Folder" to share code when using Virtual box.
    And I spent almost a day trying to SSH into my `Parallels` VM...

BTW if you still want to go with VM after this article I highly recommend using `SSH` instead of the
GUI that VM provides.

In case you don't know, to connect via `SSH` basically means that you are using your host terminal to connect to the VM, as to the server. As a result, you can execute
commands on a remote VM using your host terminal.

## The _"Smart"_ Way (Docker)

Please don't be afraid it is not that hard at all, I promise. Please look at the code above in the [TL;DR
section](#tldr).  
Does it look scary? Believe it or not, this is the only code you would need.
So if you are interested, please read further.

### Pros

-   You will learn a truly amazing technology that will be of great help to you in the future as well.
-   I had the best experience using this way.
-   If you mess your container up, you can easily restart it from its initial state.
-   You can easily make "Shared Folders" and connect them to your container.

### Cons

-   You may spend quite a bit of time, in the beginning, depending on your background.

### Explanation of Code Snippets

The FreeCodeCamp tutorial I linked above is explains everything in-depth, but here I have a small summary.

Essentially Docker Desktop for macOS is VM itself. Thus it allows us to run Linux containers on macOS.

The `Dockerfile` is a file that defines the so-called "container image". It contains the settings that you want to have
for your container.

-   `FROM ubuntu:latest` says that we want our image to be based on another image, the latest ubuntu.
-   `RUN <some command>` says docker to run this `<some command>` inside image when building. We are installing `gcc` and `make` for using this command.

The `docker-compose.yml` is a file where we define how exactly we want to run our container.

-   `image: linux-image` means that we want the container to be created from the image with the name `linux-image`
-   `command: sleep 1000` is the command which will be executed in the container. The container will be
    alive while the process executing this command is alive.
-   `volumes: .:/code` means that we map `.` folder in the host with the folder `/code/` in the container. Therefore it will be a shared folder (so-called volume).

### A Few Thing to Mention:

-   As with everything in programming, you **don't** need to know **everything** about tool to use it.
-   Docker is not a rocket science, but (especially if you are pretty new to programming) probably starting with reading dry documentation is not the brightest idea. There are great tutorials out there.
-   Docker makes a lot of things _so freaking much easier_. For example, my
    `Jekyll` website uses `Docker` because it is much faster than resolving _stupid_ gem conflicts every
    few months and making a mess of your system by installing a lot of different libraries and packages.

## Renting a Linux Server

Yes, you can always rent a Linux server and access it through `SSH`.

### Pros

-   It is a bit easier than learning `Docker`.
-   It may be useful to have your server. You can use it for hosting your website, for example.

### Cons

-   It is more expensive than using `Docker` (will cost 10-20 EUR a month).
-   You can only access the server when you have Internet.

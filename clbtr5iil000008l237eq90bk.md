### Registering Your Visit

A complete profile and visit request in our [**visit planner**](https://visit.isha.in/) is required for us to comply with Indian law, process payments and facilitate your visit. Please keep scans of your passport, visa/OCI and a recent photo ready when registering for the first time. Any accompanying guests who are residing overseas or who have an overseas passport must each complete an individual profile and visit request. Cottage accommodation can be requested through the visit planner as well. It is best to use this on a computer with Google Chrome as a browser.

**Accommodation is limited and available on a first-come, first-served basis. Please do not make any travel arrangements before receiving an email confirmation.**

You can find cottage accommodation options in the brochure attached. Alternatively, dormitory stay may be considered for those who have completed Inner Engineering including Shambhavi Mahamudra Kriya.

### Long-Term Stay Requests: 

With the completion of Inner Engineering, including Shambhavi Mahamudra Kriya, we are able to consider a stay at the Isha Yoga Center for two weeks or more (otherwise maximum stay would be one week). 

A visit request of longer than two weeks may be followed by an interview, at which time we can discuss the various aspects of your requested stay. In order to ensure sufficient time to process your request, be sure to submit any extended stay request at least 1 month prior to your intended arrival date to the Isha Yoga Center.

Please note that the daily schedule begins with sadhana/practice in the morning at 5:30 am and includes a combination of activity and meditation/practices throughout the day, ending at about 9 pm. Keeping up your sadhana and being fully engaged in your activity will be the foundation of any long-term stay.

### Participating in Programs:

[**Inner Engineering**](http://isha.sadhguru.org/isha-yoga-programs/basic-yoga/inner-engineering/) is the flagship/foundational program offered by Isha. The [**Inner Engineering Completion Online**](https://www.innerengineering.com/completion-with-sadhguru-online) has created the possibility of transmitting Shambhavi Mahamudra Kriya, a transformative 21-minute yoga practice, during these challenging times as well.
